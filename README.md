# Iris-Classification-Machine-Learning
Overview: 
This project implements a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict the classes of Iris flowers: iris-setosa, iris-versicolor, and iris-virginica. The classification is based on four features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Features:
Utilizes the KNN algorithm for classification.
Includes data cleaning techniques to handle missing or inconsistent data.
Demonstrates data visualization techniques to gain insights into the Iris dataset.
